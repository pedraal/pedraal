I'm a fullstack developer from France 🇫🇷 🥖. I love programming and learning new
tech stuff.

I really enjoy working on silly projects for a silly amount of hours to fix a
silly daylife problem that's not that annoying at all. But meeeh, I just enjoy
it 🙃. And when I'm not messing arround, I drink coffee ☕

👷 I'm currently working on a community web-based game for a french twitch
streamer (<a href="https://twitch.tv/ponce" target="_blank">Ponce</a>)

🔍 On spare time, I'm learning Typescript and Deno by developping a Static Site
Generator (not public yet, but soon soon™)

⚡ Favorite techs :

- VueJs
- NuxtJs
- TailwindCSS
- Node
- <img src="https://deno.land/logo.svg" width="24px"/>Deno Mongodb and Ruby on
  Rails
